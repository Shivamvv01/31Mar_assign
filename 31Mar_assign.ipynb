    "\n",
    "Problem Defination & Dataset Collection : First we formulate our problem defination and collect the data.This involves determining the objective of the application, identifying the relevant data sources, and collecting and cleaning the data.\n",
    "Dataset Cleaning,Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering : Then we clean the data ie.remove outliers,fill null values and convert categorical to Numerical Datatypes and select only the relevent features for model training.\n",
    "Model Training and Evaluation : This involves selecting an appropriate model, training the model on the data, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.The final model selected is then coverted to pickle file for further use in the web app.\n",
    "Web Application Development : This involves building a web interface that allows users to input data, processing user inputs, and making predictions using the trained model.The pickled file embedded in the flask web app predicts based on the input data.\n",
    "Cloud Deployment : This involves setting up the infrastructure on the cloud provider, configuring the application servers, and deploying the code. For example for deploying in AWS we use elastic beanstalk and codepipeline we add .eb extensions file.\n",
    "Monitor and Maintain : Once the application is live, it's important to monitor it regularly to ensure it's performing as expected. This includes monitoring for errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, maintenance is required to ensure the application remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and features."

    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting and managing websites and applications. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: In traditional hosting, websites and applications are hosted on physical servers that are owned and maintained by a hosting provider. These servers are typically located in data centers.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting relies on a network of virtual servers that are part of a larger infrastructure provided by a cloud service provider. These virtual servers are hosted in data centers as well, but the underlying hardware is abstracted, and resources can be dynamically allocated as needed.\n",
    "Resource Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Scaling resources (such as CPU, RAM, and storage) in traditional hosting often involves manual intervention, such as upgrading to a more powerful server or adding more physical hardware.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting allows for dynamic scalability. Resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. This flexibility is particularly advantageous for handling traffic spikes or accommodating varying workloads.\n",
    "Cost Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Typically involves a fixed monthly or annual fee, regardless of the actual resource usage. This can be less cost-effective if your website or application experiences varying levels of traffic.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting often follows a pay-as-you-go model, where you pay for the resources you consume. This can be more cost-effective for applications with fluctuating resource needs, as you only pay for what you use.\n",
    "Redundancy and Reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Reliability depends on the quality of the hosting provider's infrastructure. Redundancy and failover mechanisms may not be as advanced as those in cloud environments.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud providers typically offer high levels of redundancy, distributed data storage, and automated failover mechanisms. This enhances overall reliability and ensures minimal downtime.\n",
    "Management and Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Users have more control over the physical servers in traditional hosting, but this also means they are responsible for tasks such as server maintenance, updates, and security.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting abstracts much of the infrastructure management, with the cloud provider handling tasks like hardware maintenance, security, and updates. Users have more focus on managing their applications and data.\n",
    "Geographical Reach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting: Limited to the physical locations of the hosting provider's data centers.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud services often have a global presence with data centers in multiple regions, allowing for improved performance and accessibility worldwide."
